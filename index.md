  <p>Iâ€™m a MSc student in Business Analytics & Management at the Rotterdam School of Management with a background in Law. Currently working as a data analyst, I specialize in using tools like R, and Python for data-driven decision-making. I also have experience in tenant advocacy and policy advising. In my free time, I enjoy running marathons and participating in student committees</p>
