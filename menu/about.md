  <p>I'm a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/teaching.md %}">lecturer</a> at
  Humboldt University Berlin and Chief AI Officer at SO1.</p>

  <p> My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/publications.md %}">research</a> is
  located at the intersection of quantitative marketing, machine learning and
  econometrics. I develop and validate new machine learning methods for modeling and
  predicting the choices of individual customers and apply them to real-world marketing
  problems. My current projects focus on methodological research in Deep Learning that can
  be applied to promotion personalization in large-scale retailing settings. </p>

  <p> In my industry work, I collaborate with leading marketing solution providers and grocery
  retailers to design and implement advanced machine learning systems for scalable
  marketing personalization. These marketing solutions have helped retailers to increase
  marketing efficiency and effectiveness. </p>

  <p>Being rooted in both academia and industry provides an excellent foundation for my
  research and teaching. Understanding the challenges retailers and brands face in
  marketing personalization makes my research more meaningful and relevant. Industry
  partnerships enable me to evaluate new methodologies in the field. In teaching, my
  industry experience allows me to make marketing and machine learning theory more
  tangible.</p>
