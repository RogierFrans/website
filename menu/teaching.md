### "Machine Learning in Marketing: Theory and Applications" (WS 2020/21)

I created this new course with master students from quantitative fields such as marketing,
economics, statistics and computer science in their last year of study in mind. The course
prepares students for solving real-world marketing problems using modern quantitative
methods and is a good preparation for a machine learning/data science job in marketing or
a PhD in quantitative marketing.

To this end, the course first reviews theoretical foundations in marketing, statistics,
probability theory and computer science that are required to understand, apply and
customize complex statistical models. The course then focuses on formalizing marketing
decisions as machine learning problems and equips students with the necessary tools to
efficiently implement machine learning models and pipelines. After completing this course
participants will be able to judge how modern machine learning methods complement (or even
replace) traditional statistical methods for data analysis and decision-making.

### Guest Lectures "Machine Learning in Marketing"

Over the last couple of years I was invited by different universities (e.g., MIT Sloan
School of Management, WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management, Freie Universit√§t Berlin) to
give guest lectures on promotion personalization in Marketing. The lectures are based on
my academic work and my industry experience that I gained from my work as an entrepreneur
in several start-ups.

The lectures review basic principles on marketing strategy, formalize marketing problems,
and show how to apply machine learning methods in industry applications for price
personalization and recommender systems. I present real-world results derived from field
experiments that evaluate the economic benefits of promotion personalization.
